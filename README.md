# “Millane sää” - What's the Weather App
“Millane sää” is a fun weather app. The idea is that you can ask the so-called artificial intelligence ready-made prompts about, for example, whether you need a jacket outside or if it's dark. It gives you a simple answer based on open weather data and location, but in a hillibilly Finnish dialect of “Pori” in a funny and witty way.
