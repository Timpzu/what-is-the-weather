# “Millane sää” Weather App
“Millane sää” is a fun weather app that allows you to ask its quirky, not-so-artificial intelligence for ready-made prompts. For example, you can find out whether you need to wear a jacket outside or if it’s dark. The app provides simple answers based on open weather data and your location, delivered in a humorous, witty hillbilly Finnish dialect from Pori.
